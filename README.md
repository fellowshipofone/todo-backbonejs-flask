todo-backbonejs-flask
=====================

Is it any good? Yes.


# What is this?

This a coding test. The objective was to produce a simple todo-list based on design, with a MVC JS framework like Backbone.js (which is the one I used), and a microframwork in Python like Flask (which is also the one I used).

You can add, edit, delete tasks, mark each or all as completed.


# How do you run it?

First, make sure to have the necessary packages in your favorite virtualenv (or elsewhere). 

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run the Werkzeug/Flask server with the following command, and visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/ on your favorite web browser

   python run.py
